# Instructions:
# Complete each of these string exercises in the same way as the
# previous String1 excercises.

# D. verbing
# Given a string, if its length is at least 3, add 'ing' to its
# end unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case add 'ly'
# instead.
# If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
# Return the resulting string.


def verbing(s):
    # your code here
    return


# E. not_bad
# Given a string, find the first occurrence of the substrings
# 'not' and 'bad'. If the 'bad' follows the 'not', replace
# the whole 'not'...'bad' substring with 'good'.
# Return the resulting string.
# Example:
#   'This dinner is not that bad!' -> 'This dinner is good!'


def not_bad(s):
    # your code here
    return


# F. front_back
# Consider dividing a string into two halves.
# If the length is even, the front and back halves are the same
# length. If the length is odd, we'll say that the extra
# character goes in the front half.
#   e.g. 'abcde', the front half is 'abc', the back half 'de'.
# Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form:
#   a-front + b-front + a-back + b-back


def front_back(a, b):
    # your code here
    return


# Provided simple test() function used in main() to print
# what each function returns vs. what it's supposed to return.
def test(got, expected):
    if got == expected:
        prefix = ' OK '
    else:
        prefix = '  X '
    print('{} got: {}     expected: {}'.format(
        prefix,
        repr(got),
        repr(expected)))


# The main() function calls the above functions with interesting
# inputs, using test() to check whether each result is correct or not.
def main():
    # Each line calls one of the functions above and compares its
    # result to the expected return value for that call.
